# BEETLE: Finding New Configurations by Borrowing from Old Ones
As software systems grow in complexity and the space of possible configurations increases exponentially, finding the near-optimally performingconfiguration of a software system becomes challenging. Recent approaches address this challenge by learning performance models based on a sampleset of configurations. However, collecting enough sample configurations can be very expensive since each such sample requires configuring, compilingand executing the entire system using a complex test suite.When learning on new data is too expensive, it is possible to quickly “transfer” old lessons to the new context. But this gets complicated if there is too muchprior data to explore. Specifically, (a) learning from excessive data takes excessive time: (b) the performance of the models built via transfer can deteriorateas a result of learning from irrelevant information.To resolve these problems, we propose BEETLE, a “bellwether”-based transfer learner that focuses on just the most useful and relevant subset of the olddata. This paper evaluates BEETLE with 61 software configuration problems based on five software systems (a video encoder, an SAT solver, the SQLite database, a high-performance C-compiler, and streaming data analytics tool). In each of these cases, BEETLE found configurations that are as good as orbetter than those found by anything else while requiring only 17th of the measurements needed by prior methods.Based on these results, we say that BEETLE is a new high-water mark in configuring software systems.
